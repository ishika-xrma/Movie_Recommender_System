# Movie_Recommender_System
Developed a Machine Learning based Movie Recommender System that recommends top 5 similar movies by content based filtering using Cosine Similarity and Natural Language Processing (Bag of Words) on a 5000+ movies dataset. Integrated the model with Streamlit to create an interactive web-based API, that fetches poster along with the recommended movies via TMDb API.
I used two datasets: 1) Hollywood Dataset (5000+ movies) 2) Bollywood Dataset (2000+ movies)
